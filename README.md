## ðŸŽ¨ About

This is a project I worked on while learning [React](https://reactjs.org). This is a clone of websites like Flat UI Colors and Material UI Colors.

I learned a lot while coding this project. I ended up using React Hooks and not class components. Still need to refractor the CSS to use JSS to clean up the code. I also learned how to deal with Draggable boxes and how to properly move them.

[Material UI] was used for Icons. ChromaJS was used to get the scale for each color box and to retrieve the Luminance to make the text more visible on each box. Emoji Picker was used so the user can select an emoji when they are creating their own Color Palette.
